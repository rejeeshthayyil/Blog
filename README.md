A COMPARATIVE STUDY OF DIFFERENT
CLOUD COMPUTING DEPLOYMENT MODELS

As different types of CC require different skills and resources, choosing the appropriate type of CC to be implemented by an institution is the first crucial step to take in ensuring a successful CC implementation by that institution. Numerous institutions that have had trouble implementing their CC have done so because they picked the incorrect CC. Institutions must carefully analyze their data before determining which form of CC to apply in order to minimize implementation failure. Adopted in any CC research-based, in accordance with their geographic distribution. The deployment models of CC have been categorized as follows based on prior study on the subject.


The private cloud 

This deployment model functioned especially on behalf of company meaning this type of CC services is not accessible by the public; it is survived by the company. It might exist on or off the locations as the users of this type of CC can be from diverse units or departments but belonging to the same specific company.  The private cloud is known as the most security cloud as it data processes are controlled and managed in the company exclusive of any limitation of bandwidth network, security disclosures, and legitimate requirements using services of public cloud may necessitate.   In the private cloud, it possible that the fundamental clouds infrastructure can be leased or owned, even operated and managed by the company itself, a third-party or both.  It delivers many outcomes to a public cloud computing environment, for example, becoming a service-based also elastic.

There are two types of private cloud
1.	The on premise private cloud 
Also, called as the internal cloud, this type of private cloud is held inside the institutions personal data center. It offers an additional uniform procedure plus security, yet is frequently restricted in size and scalability. Moreover, an organization's Information Technology (IT) unit would encounter the costs of capital and operational for the physical resources with this model.

2.	The externally-hosted private cloud 
The type of private cloud model called the externally hosted is held by an outside CC provider. This CC service provider encourages a restrictive CC environment with complete guarantees of confidentiality. This type of private clouds is advised to institutions that do not favors using a public cloud infrastructure due to the fact of the because of the risks associated with the physical resources sharing.

Some characteristics of private cloud are as below:
Enhanced Security Measures
Better Customization

The public cloud

The public cloud model comes with many features as it offers applications, data storages, and many different services to its users coming from its service provider. This is based on the characteristic of the pay-as-you-go model. This cloud model is built with a perspective to provide boundless memory storage and expanded data transmission through the Internet to all organizations. It is also hosted, owned, and operated by a third-party service provider. It is as well as takes into account every sort of prerequisites from little, medium and enormous organizations.  It is considerate as the easiest to be setup since it liberates that supporter from burdens of equipment, application or transfer speed costs. Organization pays for only those services and resources they have used. Customers must pay their bill of public cloud services, monthly.

Some characteristics of public cloud are as below:

1.	Flexible and Elastic Environment
2.	Freedom of Self-Service
3.	Pay for what is used
4.	Availability and Reliability

The hybrid cloud 
This cloud is made of many of both private and public cloud which is shared between the different institutions that have similar interest and requirements.  It can be  internally managed and it can also be managed by the third-party which is inside or outside hosted. The bills of this cloud are increasing over some clients; consequently, some of the bill savings benefits of CC are accomplished. This could assist in limiting the benefits spending expenses for its founding as the prices are distributed among the companies; most of the government agencies in a single region cloud may be shareable, but not the non-government agencies [23]. However, organizations can maintain their cost and security at a reasonable level; but at the same time, there are some issues regarding standardization and interoperability of clouds, which should be considered.

Some characteristics of Hybrid cloud are as below:
1. Optimal use
2. Data center consolidation
3. Risk transfer
4. Availability 

Comparing private cloud and traditional on-premises deployments in terms of talent and skillset is an insightful exercise. Both environments have their unique challenges, but the required expertise can overlap in many areas.

Overall Talent Requirement: A private cloud setup, due to its breadth and the rapid changes in the cloud domain, generally demands a more diverse and continuously evolving skillset compared to traditional on-premises deployments.
In summary, while traditional on-premises setups might require deep expertise in specific areas, the dynamic nature of private cloud technologies often demands a wider, more adaptable skillset. If a company is transitioning from on-premises to a private cloud, there will likely be a need for reskilling, training, or even hiring to bridge the talent gap.










IaaS in a Private Cloud Deployment Model:
1. Definition:

IaaS provides virtualized computing resources over the internet. It's the most basic cloud service model and offers the infrastructure such as virtual machines, virtual networks, and storage.
Private Cloud refers to cloud computing resources used exclusively by a single organization. It can be hosted either on-premises or at a third-party data center but remains isolated from other users.

2. Why Combine IaaS with Private Cloud?
Control: Organizations can have control over the infrastructure, similar to a traditional data center, but with the advantages of cloud scalability and flexibility.
Security & Compliance: A private cloud can address specific security, data handling, and compliance requirements that might not be achievable in a public cloud setting.
Performance: Since resources are not shared with other organizations, there is potential for better and more predictable performance.
Customization: A private cloud environment can be more easily tailored to fit an organization's specific IT and business needs.

3. Considerations:
Cost: Setting up a private cloud can be more expensive than using public cloud services, due to the necessary investments in hardware, software, and expert personnel.
Maintenance: With IaaS on a private cloud, the organization is responsible for maintaining and updating the infrastructure. This can be resource-intensive.
Scalability Limitations: While a private cloud can scale, it might not do so as quickly or to the same extent as a public cloud. There are physical limits to how much you can scale based on the infrastructure you own.

4. Examples of IaaS for Private Cloud:
OpenStack: An open-source platform designed to build and manage both public clouds and private clouds.
VMware vCloud: A suite of tools from VMware for building a private cloud infrastructure.
Microsoft Azure Stack: An extension of Azure to consistently run hybrid applications on-premises.
Conclusion:
While IaaS in a private cloud deployment model offers many benefits, especially in terms of control and security, it also brings challenges, mainly around cost and complexity. When deciding, consider your organization's specific needs, budget, and in-house expertise. If the demands of managing and maintaining a private cloud become too high, you might also consider hybrid solutions that blend private and public clouds to get the best of both worlds.
In fact, this combination is quite common for organizations that want the flexibility and scalability of cloud infrastructure but also need enhanced control, security, or regulatory compliance that a private cloud offers.

Notes 
Cloud service delivery models: The three basic types are SaaS, IaaS, and PaaS

▪
Cloud deployment models: The four basic types are Public, Private, Community, and Hybrid
▪
Cloud logging: It’s a young field which is growing every day. Be sure you understand what it is you and your organization require before you embark on logging all your log data to the cloud. Be sure to ask lots of questions of whatever perspective provider you are interested in using.
▪
SIEM in the cloud: MSSPs have supported this model for years. Traditional Shrink-wrapped SIEM vendors are starting to realize the value in this model and are scrambling to build cloud capabilities and offerings into their products.
▪
Security concerns: Be sure you understand how the provider approaches IT security. Also, make sure you understand your responsibility when it comes to legislative and regulatory compliance when operating in a cloud environment.


Multitenancy risks: The shared nature of public cloud environments increases security risks, such as unauthorized viewing of data by other customers using the same hardware platform. A shared environment also presents resource competition problems whenever one of the customers uses most of the resources either due to need or due to being exposed to targeted attacks, such as DDoS.( Distributed Denial of Service)






CLOUD COMPUTING SECURITY


Cloud computing offers reliability, availability, and scalability as users access services over the internet, with software and services available on-demand. However, it introduces new risks as all data is stored in the cloud, making it a target for hackers seeking confidential information. Advancements in security can help prevent unauthorized access. Techniques like key-splitting and homomorphic encryption are promising areas of research for enhancing cloud security. The focus is on ensuring secure data transfer between users and cloud providers over secure channels.

Cloud computing faces seven identified security concerns in research. The most significant concerns are data tampering and leakage, which involve unauthorized users attempting to access or alter cloud data. Data intrusion, while similar, uses different methods of breach. Data confidentiality and availability are primary concerns for both clients and service providers. Secure communication between clients and providers is also a major risk. 


 

Data tampering and leakage is the real concern of users in several domains.  
Data leakage is a significant cloud security concern, as data can be altered or deleted without a backup. Cloud storage reliability is often questioned due to potential access by insiders and third parties. Some companies providing cloud services can be seen as untrustworthy. To address this, a utility-based approach can detect malicious user behavior, enabling data recovery. The Unity service offers a personal repository, setting it apart from other cloud services.
The second identified threat is the data intrusion in cloud computing. While adopting cloud computing services, an intrusion detection system (IDS) provides a solution to security threats. 
Data storage, data confidentiality, and data availability in cloud services are among the other identified threats to cloud computing security. For example, outsourcing stored data at the cloud requires an additional security layer to strengthen the data confidentiality.

Commercial Cloud Computing Providers and Security Challenges 

A survey study  finds that the top five cloud providers, including Amazon, Azure, Adobe, Google cloud platform, and VMWare, are efficient in their cloud services’ data security feature. Reliability and performance are among other features. To measure the cloud providers’ trustworthiness is still an issue and  a customer cannot judge it without appropriate tools.  Containers launched by VMs provide a security sandboxing mechanism, allowing cloud providers to manage applications efficiently. However, managing applications at the edge poses challenges. When multiple tenants run applications on the same host resource, security and privacy issues emerge. Studies on commercial service providers indicate that cloud service models can exacerbate these security concerns.  Therefore, it is users’ workload based on the sensitive data that they do not need to outsource to a public cloud directly. Outsourcing the consumers’ data and addressing the associated risks is challenging for both users and cloud service providers. 


AWS and Microsoft Azure policies clearly state that customers need to address the security of their data, operating system, application, and their configuration, identity, and access management in a shared responsibility. The AWS only considers the hardware, software, and networking facilities security. Cloud users mistakenly assume that their public IaaS providers have responsibility for securing their data, operating system, and applications.
